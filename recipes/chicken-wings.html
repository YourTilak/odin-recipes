        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These za'atar chicken wings are gorgeous, fragrant, savory, and citrusy. The big, bold flavors are best served with tahini dipping sauce or any yogurt-based sauce. I recommend you make a double or triple batch of za’atar, because you will want to season just about everything with za’atar once you’ve tasted it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Za'atar</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons marjoram</li>
            <li>1 rounded tablespoon sumac</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Wings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 1/2 pounds whole chicken wings, cut into flat and drum sections</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 large egg white</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley (optional)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sumac, for dusting (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>For za'atar, grind thyme with a mortar and pestle, or using a spice grinder. Add marjoram and grind fine; place thyme and marjoram in a small bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Add sumac, sesame seeds, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne, and stir thoroughly. Store in an airtight container until needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>For wings, cut whole wings into flat and drum sections, and add to a bowl. Add salt and garlic powder, and mix thoroughly. Cover; refrigerate for at least 2 or up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Whisk egg white, honey, and lemon juice together in a small bowl until foamy. Pour over wings and stir thoroughly. Add za’atar, and toss until evenly coated. Arrange wings, evenly spaced, on the prepared pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms of wings start to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven; turn wings over.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Continue baking until wings are well browned, and meat easily pulls off the bone, 20 to 30 minutes more.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 8: </strong>Rest wings for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Place on a serving tray, drizzle with olive oil, and top with parsley. Sprinkle with additional sumac or za’atar if desired. For a sweeter, stickier version, drizzle with a little more honey.</li>
        </ol>
